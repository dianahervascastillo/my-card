# My Card


## Development

If you want to test the app locally

    npm install
    npm run


If you want to test the app with a production build (you'll need to install serve ```npm install -g serve``` )

    npm run build
    npm serve -s build
    
 Once you get the local url or network url, you can test it in diff browsers.
